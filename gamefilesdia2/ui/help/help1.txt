Diabolika is a grid-based puzzle game where you
must fight off a Dark Horde of demons with an
array of explosive and magickal devices.

The game progresses through a series of rounds,
during which you pick and place your units on the
game board. When a unit explodes, it can explode
other units around it. Try to arrange your units
in such a way that they make a chain reaction.
That is the best way to destroy the most demons
each round.

The three skulls on the left display the status
of your game. From left to right, they are: the
number of units available for the current round,
the number of detonators available for the current
round, and the number of demons alive on the board.

Below the skulls is where your available units
sit. Once you pick a unit and place it on the
board, another takes its place on the left. You
always have three units available.

Below that your score is displayed.
