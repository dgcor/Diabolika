These are some of the basic units
that are available to you during
the game. When detonated, each
one explodes differently. It's
up to you to figure out how to
use them to maximize your des-
tructive potential.

The yellow grid represents the
area that could be affected by
the explosion. The green square
represents the unit. The red
squares represent the tiles that
will detonate if the unit is
blown up.
