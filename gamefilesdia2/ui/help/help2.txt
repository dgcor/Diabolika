Regeneration: Demons are summoned onto the game
board. The player does nothing during this phase.

Alignment: Three units are always available for
you to pick from the sidebar. Left-click a unit
to select it, and then left-click again on the
board to place it. Right-click while the unit
is selected to rotate it. Left-click on the
empty space in the sidebar to return the unit.
After all your available units are placed on the
board, the Detonation phase begins.

Detonation: You are given two detonators per round.
Left-click on a tile to detonate it. If you detonate
a tile with a unit on it, that unit will explode.
If you detonate a demon directly, it will take one
damage. When the detonation phase is over, another
round will begin.

The game is over if there are ten or more demons
alive on the board after the Detonation phase ends.
