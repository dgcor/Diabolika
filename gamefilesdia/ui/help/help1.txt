DIABOLIKA HELP FILE -
_________________

Diabolika is a puzzle game where the object is to keep back the horde of demons
that appear on the screen. The game progresses in different phases:

Phase One: Placing tiles - You are given a limited number of tiles to place at the
beginning of each round. You can choose from the three tiles on the sidebar. Click
on the tile you want, and move the tile to where you want to place it. Certain tiles
may be rotated by right clicking. After you place a tile, a new tile will replace it on
the sidebar. Press spacebar to cancel a tile you've selected.

Phase Two: Detonation - You are given two detonators per round. Place your
mottled, green hand over the tile or demon which you want to detonate, and
left-click.  The idea is to create a chain reaction of exploding tiles to take out as many
demons as possible. Extra points are awarded for destroying large numbers of
demons and tiles at once. If, at the end of this phase, there are 10 demons on the
screen, you lose.

Phase Three: Regeneration - New demons and walls appear on the screen,
becoming stronger and with greater numbers with each passing round.
