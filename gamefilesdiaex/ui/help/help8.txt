Rather than left-clicking on your units to pick
them, you can press '1', '2', and '3', correspond-
ing to the units from left to right. This can
save some much needed time in the later levels!

On the same note, you can press the same number to
return the currently active unit back to the side-
bar.

Space or return places the unit in the board and
[1], [2], [3], [4] / up, down, left, right move the unit.

Press [5] or left-click to rotate the selected unit.

You can load (F8) and save (F5) the current game.
