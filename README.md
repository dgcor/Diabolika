You need the original game files (bgm, gfx, sfx) to be inside the gamefilesdia2 folder.  
Press F1 to change settings, apply shaders, etc.

If you want to have upscaled graphics, use an images upscaler (https://sourceforge.net/projects/xbrz/)
and save a copy of each image with 2x the resolution in gamefilesdia2/gfx2x and press F1 to use the new scaled images.
